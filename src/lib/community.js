    description: 'The Denver Vue.js Meetup is a monthly meetup of the local Vue.js community. I have helped organize it since September, 2017. I have hosted several meetups, including project nights, workshops, and talks. I set the schedule, found speakers, facilitated the networking and news, and provided food for the meetup.

    description: 'Learn to Code is an event put on by Galvanize that provides basic lessons in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for free. As a student and since becoming a resident instructor I have helped out with several Learn to Code events. The cirriculum is self-paced, so participating as a teaching assistant entails: facilitating a group working on one of the three subjects, answering questions, leading small breakout lessons, and mentoring participants who need additional help.',

    description: "Startup Weekend EDU was a weekend long event where participants pitch ideas, form teams, produce as much of a business plan and product as they can, and then present their startups at the end. This event was particularly special for me as it led to the creation of Little Bird. I went without an idea of my own, but I was immediatly drawn to Jill's. I was fortunante enough to join her team, along with some truely talented people. We were able to complete a lot of market and user reasearch, put together a strong business plan, and Caroline and I built a very basic texting chatbot. I learned a lot from the experience, both about development in a time crunch and about starting a business. Little Bird won first place at the event and we are continuing to build our way to product launch.",

    description: 'Startup Weekend Food + Tech was held in Boulder. It was a weekend long event where participants pitch ideas, form teams, produce as much of a business plan and product as they can, and then present their startups at the end. I learned a lot about food, something I was mostly only familiar with eating and about designing a solid business plan. As the only one in our group with experience at a Startup Weekend I was called upon for advice about how to approach the problem in the time given. I had to keep my group, full of talented and passionate people, on task while building a website for our product. This led to me being more involved in the business side, which was a great opportunity for me to learn.',
