In particular, I wrote the assessments for using git and github for version control and then later for using them for collaboration. Each assessment included three drills for which I needed to: determine a deliverable that would allow us to measure completion of a drill, write instructions for the students, generate resources for the drill, write a grading rubric, and provide a solutions branch for reference. For the collaborating with git drill I produced an app that generated random tasks for them to complete to simulate a collabrative development project.',
